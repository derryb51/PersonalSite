                            Hi! Iâ€™m Derry and I am a Software Engineer working with a Cloud Computing unit in Fidelity Investments. 
                            As an Under-Grad, I studied Geography(Urbanization) & Economics at Maynooth University.

                        <p> 
                            Here I developed a strong interest of the application of technology in the urban realm, 
                            in particular its use in solving human-centric problems. 
                            My thesis sought to identify the extent to which digital platforms are used in cities to enable 
                            the efficient use of otherwise underused assets.

                            After graduating from university in 2018, I took a gap year and moved back to Toronto 
                            (I also studied there for a year). As planned, I then returned to Ireland to undertake a post-grad in 
                            Software Development. Throughout this I got some work experience with a Tech-Ops tean where
                            developed a passion for the Cloud & the DevOps space.

                        <p> 
                            I then joined Fidelity Investments as a Software Engineering Associate. 
                            Here, I work with cutting edge technology on exciting projects ðŸ˜„.
