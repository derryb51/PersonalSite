Hi! Iâ€™m Derry and I am a Software Engineer working with a Cloud Computing unit in Fidelity Investments. For my Undergrad, I studied Geography(Urbanization) & Economics at Maynooth University. I developed a strong interest of the application of technology in the urban realm, in particular its use in solving human-centric problems. My thesis sought to identify the extent to which digital platforms are used in cities to enable the efficient use of otherwise underused assets. Here is a link :) My passion for Smart City tech & IoT remains has not faded and I try to say up to date in the space as much as possible!

After graduating from university in 2018, I took a gap year and moved back to Toronto (I also studied there for a year). As planned, I then returned to Ireland to undertake a post-grad in Software Development. Throughout this I got some work experience with a Tech-Ops tean where developed a passion for the Cloud & the DevOps space. I then joined Fidelity Investments as a Software Engineering Associate. Here, I work with cutting edge technology on exciting projects ðŸ˜„.

Technologies I am currently working with:

    Javascript(ES6+) & Typescript
    HTML5 & (S)CSS
    Angular
    SQL & NoSQL
    Java & Spring
    Amazon Web Services
    Docker
    Kubernetes
    Jenkins

I also have experience with other frameworks such as React, if you check out my GitHub, you'll see it was used to develop this site:D
